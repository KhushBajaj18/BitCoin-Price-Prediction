# BitCoin-Price-Prediction
This is an ML model which predicts the price of bitcoin from a Historical Dataset


To use the model run the Python code in on your Machine or Google Colab.
Keep in mind that you need to provide the historical dataset by yourself in the form of .csv file
Keep both the code and csv file in the same file location and mention the csv file name in the code(it's pretty easy to place it just look at the code carefully, and you will find it out) 

Dont worry I will provide the dataset in this repo itself. For the information, I took it from Kaggle.com


So now you can make a lot of money by trading bitcoin
